        <title>Perspectives</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Daenerys Targaryen just went rouge on the show to burn down kings landing, thousands of innocent citizens were burnt to a crisp thanks to a sudden onset of madness along with whatever little credibility the show had remaining. To everyone complaining the last few years on how awful Throne’s writing had become this was vindication, a finale that says the show runners do not understand or care for the world they are portraying. At this point it’s just painful to watch the show that brought so many people into George’s world and became synonymous with nerd culture consistently flop this hard.
I for one am thankful to the show and D&amp;amp;D for the early seasons, it got me into reading the series and all of George’s books on the universe and back to reading proper after a drought that lasted years. And now I’m obsessed with it, epic battles during the dance, parallels between Ser Duncan the Tall and Brieanne of Tarth, the rivalry between bittersteel and bloodraven.. GRRM’s epic universe..
We can find some peace now that the show is ending and hopefully WoW coming out this year. With just one more episode left maybe it’s time to accept Game of Thrones for what it is, cherish the happy memories it gave and let it go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\ Real life parallels.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A bit of spark</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Spark is interesting, from it’s name to the way it is implemented. A distributed data set? What’s next, a multi cluster linked list, how about a hash map?? Yeah, we have those, they are called caches..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why get into spark in the first place? Well, it is open-source, it is interesting, it supports the only language that I know well enough to not need reference while learning something new(Java).. and, I’m totally bored..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What spark is:
A highly scalable, highly performant data processing framework that originated from what hadoop missed out on. It is meant for batch processing large volumes of data, but has added support for streams (albeit a bit hacky). Spark wins all performance comparisons with it’s predecessor hadooop hands down and has been the reining champion of distributed data processing for sometime now, thought this may not be for long with Flink coming into picture. But first mover advantage counts a lot.. so yeah Spark..!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it is meant to do:
Ingest loads of data, process it, and give it to whomever needs it, simple as that. You can write jobs on spark to do whatever, word count (the usual first example), extraction, ML, log analysis.. whatever.. Just one caveat, it being distributed your jobs better honor the data partition if you want spark to be perform as spark is meant to perform, else you will find data being written to disk and waits for processing to complete and a lot of more bottlenecks.
Spark also provides some measures of failure tolerence, the usual distributed systems stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How it does all this:
RDDs and DAGs
also Mesos/YARN&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>hello World</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog may have software stuff, hence the first post should be called hello world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because convention, that’s why..  And because a programmer should be terrible at naming things..&lt;/p&gt;
