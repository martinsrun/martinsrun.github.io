    <p>Daenerys Targaryen just went rouge on the show to burn down kings landing, thousands of innocent citizens were burnt to a crisp thanks to a sudden onset of madness along with whatever little credibility the show had remaining. To everyone complaining the last few years on how awful Throne’s writing had become this was vindication, a finale that says the show runners do not understand or care for the world they are portraying. At this point it’s just painful to watch the show that brought so many people into George’s world and became synonymous with nerd culture consistently flop this hard.
I for one am thankful to the show and D&amp;D for the early seasons, it got me into reading the series and all of George’s books on the universe and back to reading proper after a drought that lasted years. And now I’m obsessed with it, epic battles during the dance, parallels between Ser Duncan the Tall and Brieanne of Tarth, the rivalry between bittersteel and bloodraven.. GRRM’s epic universe..
We can find some peace now that the show is ending and hopefully WoW coming out this year. With just one more episode left maybe it’s time to accept Game of Thrones for what it is, cherish the happy memories it gave and let it go.</p>

<p>\ Real life parallels.</p>
