Reactive Systems : Readily responsive to stimulus
 - Reacts to events (event-driven)
 - Reacts to load (scalable)
 - Reacts to failures (resilient)
 - Reacts to users (responsive)


 - Event Driven:
    - Being event driven supports scalability and resilience
    - Traditional system has threads communicating with shared mutable states, resulting in strong coupling and were hard to componse
    - Event driven systems use decoupled event handlers that are non-blocking and asynchronous. This allows better resource utilization.

  - Scalable:
    - Minimizing shared mutalble state is important for scalability.
    - To scale out, system should be location independent and should be resilient to node failures

  - Resilience:
    - Quick recovery from failures, internal or external
    - Resilience should be a design goal of the system and cannot be later added on

  - Responsive
    - Rich real time user-experience even under high load and in the presence of failures
    - Responsiveness can be provided by an event-driven, scalable and resilient system
