Trail running is the closest I have been to experiencing spirituality.  When the body is depleted and the mind grinds through pain, nature becomes a welcome distraction. Dulling your senses in the lush forest greenery, the crisp air, the mud, rocks, streams, squirrels, everything helps drown out screams of agony from your legs.  

People do ask "why run?", the honest response would be to ask them back "why not.." (My reply is usually something more socially acceptable, health/weight/fitness). In an existance without meaning, running is what I choose to add value to life. It gives me purpose, goals and keeps me sane through the darkest times. Fitness is just an added perk.
