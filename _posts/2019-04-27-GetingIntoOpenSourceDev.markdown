Solr or Spark, flume or flink, which Apache foundation project can I get involved in? How about CNCF? Yeah there are tonnes of open source libs in development within GitHub now, but I don't do JavaScript or python, putting most of them out of contention. What does a Java guy contribute to? The Biggie's that started, things like solr or Spark needs weeks if not months of effort to get into the project, let alone contribute.. so here is what I need now, a low barrier to entry open source project that is active and has enough challenges for me to be interested.. Does something like Netty of httplibs take contributions or being core libraries do they discourage newbies?
