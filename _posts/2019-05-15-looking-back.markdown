Daenerys Targaryen just went rouge on the show to obliterate Kings Landing as well as whatever little credibility the show had remaining.
The finale was vindication to everyone hating on the Throne's writing since season 5-6, the show runners not understanding or caring for the world they are portrayed. It had become painful to watch the show which brought so many people into GrrM's world, made fantasy cool and became synonymous with nerd culture consistently flop this hard.
 The show and showrunners have my thanks for introducing the series and everyting else GrrM's has written on the universe, epic battles during the dance, parallels between Ser Duncan the Tall and Brieanne, the rivalry between bittersteel and bloodraven.
Atleast some peace now that the show is ending and hopefully The Winds of Winter will be out soon. With just one more episode left it's time to accept Game of Thrones for the mediocre mass market show it has become, cherish the happy memories it gave and let it go.
