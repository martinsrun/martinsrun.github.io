Attention in the digital age is a hard thing to maintain, us short attention span folks who have had it difficult long before setting eyes on a smartphone, now find it maddening. Life works well with With a single project, the steps are usually direct: clear distractions, focus on the problems, analyze, fix, progress.
But in times of uncertainty, options and decisions can get overwhelming the path of least resistance usually leads to a screen that makes temporarily makes it all go away.  All the different lines of thought wind up into a giant ball, it becomes impossible to know where each issue begins or ends. Figuring out what to work on becomes the work, decision paralysis: too many options, everything depends on each other, no plan of action, procrastinate.
This is why de-cluttering your mind is important, writing down your ideas help unravel the ball and separate each strand. Have a journal that helps measure points against each other, understand what they lead to, prioritize and plan actionable items against them. Once things are set in ink, you have accountability, it is there on paper, you know what to do and it's go time.
