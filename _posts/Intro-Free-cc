Today marks the day-0 of my aspirations to get into front-end development, having avoided html/css for years, and not touched javascript in over 5 years.. This should be interesting to see what happens over the next few weeks/months.

The journey begins at free-code-camp, which comes recommended by multiple reliable sources (I have been on Quincy Larson's mailing list for a few years now). The first step is the course on responsive web design which covers HTML5/CSS, and the expected duration is 300 hours (gasp!). A quick breakdown on that, 300 hours at 2 hrs per day on avg is 150 days.. Waaay too long for an HTML course, so unless the 300 hours is a far over estimation, I would be skipping what is easy or obvious. 

Without procrastinating further, diving into the first lesson:

# Basic HTML and HTML5
