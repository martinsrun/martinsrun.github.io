# Basic CSS
CSS inspires more terror than any complex problem.. Give me a hard alogrithem problem any day, but dont ask to center align text on a div. Finally committing to learn something this basic, its actually not difficuly, judt annoying..

First few lessons were all about css elements, styling texts with colors, fonts sizes, styling images with borders.. Things to note are, elements can be picked of a page by element-type, id (referenced by "#id"), or better by class (referenced by ".class"). Id takes precedence over class..

3 important properties surround each html element: padding, border, margin
Padding: controls distance between an element content and its border, distance between text inside a box and the border of the box. Padding on each side of an element can be individually controlled by padding-left, padding-right, padding-top, padding-bottom. Or in a single line as padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; (top, right,bottom,left)
Margin: Controls distance between an element's border and its surrounding element. A large margin can make an element appear smaller since it allocates more space outside. Margin for each side of an element can be controlled by, margin-top, margin-bottom, margin-left, margin-right. Or in a single line with margin: 10px 20px 10px 20px; (top, right,bottom,left)
